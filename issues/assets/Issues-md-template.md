# {Project Name}

{One-paragraph description: what app or repo this tracker covers, what platforms it targets, what kinds of issues belong here.}

This file is the local guide for managing issues in this project. The companion Mac app (Issues.app) watches the `issues/` folder and renders the current state. Markdown files are the source of truth — there is no JSON, generated artifact, or index to keep in sync.

## Folder layout

## Status values

| File value | Display name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | Open | Filed but not yet started |
| `in-progress` | In Progress | Actively being worked on |
| `resolved` | Resolved | Work is done; awaiting user confirmation |
| `closed` | Closed | User has confirmed the fix |
| `wontfix` | Won't Fix | Acknowledged but won't be addressed |

Use the **file value** (lowercase, hyphenated) in the issue's metadata table. The Mac app converts to the display name when rendering.

## Critical rule: never close without explicit confirmation

The most important rule of this workflow: an issue must **never** be marked `resolved`, `closed`, or `wontfix` based on inference. Only when the user has said so in plain language. Specifically, do not infer resolution from:

- a code change you (or a subagent) just made
- a commit message
- the filing of a related issue
- the user saying "thanks, that looks better"

Leave status at `open` (or `in-progress` if work has started) until the user confirms in words like "close this", "this is fixed", "mark resolved", or "won't fix". When in doubt, ask.

The deliberate exception: a subagent that finishes a fix may set `resolved` (work-is-done-but-not-confirmed). It must not set `closed` — that's the user's call. This separation is the entire reason `resolved` and `closed` are different states.

## Git tracking

This project's choice on whether `issues/` is in git determines whether lifecycle events produce commits. Check on every operation:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null   # is this a git repo?
git check-ignore -q issues/                        # exit 0 = ignored, 1 = tracked
```

- **Not a git repo, or `issues/` is ignored**: edit files only; never commit. The Mac app still tracks changes from the working copy.
- **`issues/` is tracked**: each lifecycle event below produces its own commit.

When tracked:

| Event | What's committed | Commit message |
|---|---|---|
| File a new issue | the new `NNNN.md` (and `Issues.md` if newly created) | `#NNNN <issue title>` |
| Resolve — code commit | code changes only | `#NNNN <verb> <title>` |
| Resolve — resolution commit | markdown update (status + Closed + Commit + summary) | `#NNNN Resolve: <title>` |
| Bail with notes | markdown only | `#NNNN Notes: <brief>` |
| User-confirmed close | markdown only | `#NNNN Close` |
| Won't fix | markdown only | `#NNNN Won't fix` |

**Working-copy-only changes (no commit):**

- Setting status to `in-progress` at the start of work — transient; the resolve commits supersede it. Committing every status flip would create noise.

**Why two commits to resolve, not one:** the **Commit** metadata row records the hash of the code-fix commit, and that hash isn't known until *after* the code commit lands. Splitting resolution into a code commit and a resolution commit keeps each commit single-purpose ("fix the code", "document the fix") and lets the resolution commit reference the hash cleanly.

## Issue file format

Each issue is `NNNN.md` (4-digit zero-padded) with this structure:

```markdown
# NNNN — Title

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | open |
| **Module** | <module name(s)> |
| **Platform** | iOS · macOS · iPadOS · All |
| **First seen** | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Description

What is wrong. Lead with the punchline — the first paragraph shows in the Mac app summary.

## Steps to reproduce

1. …
2. …

## Expected behavior

What should happen.

## Actual behavior

What actually happens.

## Attachments

![caption](NNNN/screenshot.png)

## Notes

Any additional context, guesses at root cause, related code locations.
```

### Format details that matter

- **Title separator** is an em-dash (U+2014, `—`), not a hyphen.
- **Metadata field rows** must keep the field name in `**bold**` exactly.
- **Dates** are `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Module** can list multiple modules separated by ` / ` (e.g. `BlueskyFeed / BlueskyDataStore`).
- **Platform** is `iOS`, `macOS`, `iPadOS`, `All`, or any other string. `All` is treated as matching every platform filter.
- When status moves to `resolved` or `closed`, add a `**Closed**` row with today's date. When the move to `resolved` is the result of a fix commit, also add a `**Commit**` row with the short hash (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`).
- Steps / Expected / Actual / Attachments / Notes are conventional but not all required — for design-refinement or feature-gap issues, Description alone is fine.

## Filing a new issue

1. Find the highest existing `NNNN.md` and increment. Start at `0001` if the folder is empty. Skip past reserved high numbers (e.g. `8888`, `9999` for test issues).
2. Create `issues/NNNN.md` from the template.
3. Set status to `open`.
4. Use today's date for First seen.
5. Phrase the title as a single declarative sentence describing the bug, not a question or a fix description.
6. **If `issues/` is tracked by git**, commit the new file with message `#NNNN <issue title>` so the issue enters git history with its `open` status. If ignored, skip.

## Updating an issue

Edit the file in place. The Mac app picks up changes automatically — no follow-up command. Touch only the rows or sections that changed; don't reformat the rest.

When status moves to `resolved` or `closed`, add a `**Closed**` row with the date. When the move to `resolved` was driven by a fix commit, also add a `**Commit**` row with the short hash. For any move toward `resolved`, `closed`, or `wontfix`, the "Critical rule" near the top of this file applies — those transitions require explicit user confirmation, not inference.

## Resolving an issue (the standard workflow)

Each open issue is handled by a fresh subagent. The orchestrator picks the issue; the subagent does the work in isolation and returns when done.

### Orchestrator: pick and dispatch

1. List `issues/*.md` (skip `Issues.md`). Pick the lowest-numbered file whose status is `open`.
2. Spawn a fresh subagent with the issue id and instructions to follow the resolve workflow below.
3. When the subagent returns, move on to the next open issue (or stop if only one was requested).

If the user names a specific issue ("fix 0046"), dispatch to that id directly.

### Subagent: claim → fix → build → commit → resolve

A subagent starts with fresh context, so its first job is loading the project's conventions before touching anything.

1. **Orient in the project.** Read these in order, every time:
   - **`issues/Issues.md`** (this file) — status vocabulary, module conventions, build/verify command, commit conventions, project-specific rules. **Authoritative for issue-tracking workflow.**
   - **`CLAUDE.md`** at the repo root, if it exists — project-wide guidance, code conventions, restricted areas, build/test commands. **Treat its instructions as binding.**
   - **`issues/NNNN.md`** — the issue you're working on, in full, including attachments in `issues/NNNN/`.

   If the two project guides disagree, prefer `CLAUDE.md` for code/repo conventions and this file for issue-tracking specifics.

2. **Set status to `in-progress`** in the markdown — working copy only, no commit. The Mac app picks it up immediately.
3. **Make the code changes** required to fix the bug.
4. **Run the project build / verification command** and confirm it passes. Fix failures caused by your changes. If the build was already failing before you started, note it on the issue and bail — don't fix unrelated breakage.

5. **Make the code commit.** Stage *only the code changes* (not the issue markdown yet). The message starts with `#NNNN` and a short, declarative title — pick the verb that actually fits (`Fix`, `Add`, `Refactor`, `Update`, `Remove`, etc.); not every issue is a bug fix. Leave a blank line after the title, then add a paragraph of details. Example:

   ```
   #0046 Add navigation from avatar tap to profile

   The avatar tap on PostCardView was not wired to any NavigationLink.
   Threaded the author DID through the cell and connected onTapGesture
   to push ProfileView.
   ```

6. **Capture the commit hash** with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.

7. **Update the issue markdown** to mark it resolved:
   - Change Status to `resolved`.
   - Add a `**Closed**` row with today's date.
   - Add a `**Commit**` row with the short hash from step 6.

   Then add a structured summary in this order so the issue becomes a primary-source record:

   - **`## Root cause`** — what was actually wrong (often different from the original report).
   - **`## Fix`** — the approach taken.
   - **`## Files changed`** — bulleted list, one bullet per file, with a short note describing what changed in each.
   - **`## Gotchas`** *(optional)* — surprises, dead ends, non-obvious behavior, or anything a future engineer working on similar code should know. Skip if nothing is notable. Be specific — these notes accumulate across issues and feed future "common pitfalls" docs.

8. **If `issues/` is tracked by git, make the resolution commit.** Stage `issues/NNNN.md` and commit with message `#NNNN Resolve: <title>`. Body briefly notes which code commit it pairs with (the hash from step 6). If `issues/` is ignored or there's no repo, skip — the markdown change from step 7 is the entire record.

Status flow: `open` → `in-progress` → `resolved`. **Never set `closed`** — the user does that after verifying the fix.

### Build / verify command for this project

<!-- Replace this with the actual command(s) used to verify a fix in this project. Delete if the project has these documented elsewhere (e.g. CLAUDE.md). -->

- e.g. `xcodebuild -scheme MyApp build` or `npm test`

### When the subagent can't finish

If the bug is unreproducible, out of scope, or the build won't pass after reasonable effort:

1. **Discard or stash any partial code changes** so the bail doesn't accidentally include half-done work.
2. **Revert status to `open`** in the issue markdown so the issue goes back into the queue.
3. **Add a `## Notes` section** describing what was tried, why work stopped, and what you'd try next. Be specific.
4. **If `issues/` is tracked by git**, commit the markdown change with message `#NNNN Notes: <one-line bail summary>`. If ignored, skip.
5. Return with a one-line summary of why work stalled.

Never use `wontfix` or `closed` to escape a stuck issue.

## Attachments

Screenshots, crash logs, console output, sample data, etc. live in a sibling folder `issues/NNNN/`. Reference them with paths *relative to the issue's `.md` file* — that means the folder prefix `NNNN/` is part of the link target. The bytes that ship are `1335/screenshot.png`, not `screenshot.png` and not `issues/1335/screenshot.png`.

```
issues/1335.md           ← the markdown that contains the link
issues/1335/screenshot.png   ← the file being linked

# inside 1335.md the link reads:
![caption](1335/screenshot.png)
```

Concrete example with both image and video attachments:

```markdown
## Attachments

![Reply button does nothing when tapped](1335/screenshot.png)
![Crash log](1335/crash.log)
[![Sidebar resize jitter](1335/sidebar-resize-jitter.poster.png)](1335/sidebar-resize-jitter.mov)
```

### Videos (`.mov`, `.mp4`, etc.)

Videos can't be embedded as `![…](…)` — markdown renderers treat that as an `<img>` and a `.mov` won't load. Instead, generate a poster frame with `qlmanage` and emit an image-inside-a-link (shown in the example above). Quick recipe — copy the video into `issues/NNNN/` first, then:

```bash
qlmanage -t -s 1280 -o issues/NNNN issues/NNNN/<basename>.<ext>
mv issues/NNNN/<basename>.<ext>.png issues/NNNN/<basename>.poster.png
```

`qlmanage` ships with macOS — no install. It reliably produces posters for AVFoundation-supported formats: `.mov`, `.mp4`, `.m4v`, `.qt`. For `.avi` it usually works; for `.mkv` and `.webm` it generally fails on stock macOS unless a third-party Quick Look generator is installed. If the rename step doesn't produce the `.poster.png`, fall back to the plain `![alt](NNNN/file.mov)` form with a `<!-- poster generation failed -->` HTML comment in the Attachments section. Don't apply the link wrapper to plain images, and don't generate posters for animated GIFs.

### macOS screenshot / screen recording filename gotcha

macOS Screenshot and Screen Recording filenames both use a **narrow no-break space** (U+202F) before AM/PM, visually identical to a regular space. A literal `cp` of the quoted filename will fail with "No such file or directory". Use a glob to skip past it:

```bash
mkdir -p issues/NNNN
cp ~/Desktop/Screenshot\ YYYY-MM-DD\ at\ H.MM.SS*PM.png issues/NNNN/screenshot.png
cp ~/Desktop/Screen\ Recording\ YYYY-MM-DD\ at\ H.MM.SS*PM.mov issues/NNNN/recording.mov
```

The `*` matches the U+202F. Substitute the actual timestamp; if you don't know which file the user means, list `~/Desktop/Screenshot*` or `~/Desktop/Screen\ Recording*` by mtime and pick the most recent.

## Module conventions for this project

<!-- List the canonical module / area names so issues stay consistent. Delete this section if not relevant. -->

- e.g. `BlueskyFeed`, `BlueskyAuth`, `Bluesky-SwiftUI`
